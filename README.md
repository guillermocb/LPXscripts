# LPXscripts

## About

LPXscripts is an open source endeavor to complement the Logic Pro Scripter Plugin. It has two major components: a library of scripts for the plugin, and a [website](https://kabirnagral.github.io/LPXscripts/) that serves as a guide to the plugin.

## Library

LPXscripts has a library of functions written in Javascript that are meant to be used as user-created scripts for the Logic Pro scripter plugin.

### Locating the Library

The library of scripts can be found in the *Library* folder.

### Using the Library

Open the *Library* folder. Open one of the javascript files (the files with the *.js* file format). Copy the code from the file and paste it into the plugin's Script Editor. Run the script and you're good to go!

Refer to [this guide](https://kabirnagral.github.io/LPXscripts/#how-to-use-library) for more!
